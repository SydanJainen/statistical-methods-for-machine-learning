## That Are the request
 Download the Spotify Tracks Dataset and perform ridge regression to predict the tracksâ€™ popularity. Note that this dataset contains both numerical and categorical features. The student is thus required to follow these guidelines:
- train the model using only the numerical features;
- appropriately handle the categorical features (for example, with one-hot encoding or other techniques) and use them together with the numerical ones to train the model,
in both cases, experiment with different training parameters;
- use 5-fold cross validation to compute your risk estimates;
- thoroughly discuss and compare the performance of the model;

The student is required to implement from scratch (without using libraries, such as Scikit-learn) the code for the ridge regression, while it is not mandatory to do so for the implementation of the 5-fold cross-validation.
Optional: Instead of regular ridge regression, implement kernel ridge regression using a Gaussian kernel.
